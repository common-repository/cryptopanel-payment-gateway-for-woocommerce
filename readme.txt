== Description ==

The CryptoPanel Payment Gateway for WooCommerce allows you to receive payments in the cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dash and Litecoin.
Compared to other crypto payment service providers, CryptoPanel offers the possibility to be the sole owner of the private keys.
For this purpose, a CryptoGate server is required. The server can either be booked as a service at www.cryptopanel.de or operated by the company itself with technical know-how.
The source code for the CryptoGate server can be found on Github under [CryptoGate](https://github.com/lampsolutions/CryptoGate).

If you have any questions about CryptoGate and/or CryptoPanel, please feel free to send us a request via our contact form on [www.cryptopanel.de](https://www.cryptopanel.de).
